# Tune into Your Heart (TIYA)

Project Overview:
-----------------
Modulating heart rate interoception through music feedback to check if getting in tune with your heart has an impact on your performance in cognitive tasks and emotional state.

### Goals:

### Literature:
Please see *TIYA/Literature* folder for pdf versions of the literature.

### Experiment Design:
Heart rate data for each participant will be taken for one hour (during which they will be asked to relax or take a nap for the first 30 minutes [RHR - Resting heart rate] and perform the task as a practice session of the main experiment for the last 30 minutes [AHR - Active Heart Rate]) to determine their average resting heart rate for these two conditions.

Then, after a break of 20 minutes each participant will perform a battery of standardized cognitive tests such as SART, Flankers and Posner’s Cueing while listening to beats which are either in tune with their average RHR, AHR or a random frequency beat across three randomized blocks, each with a duration of 30 minutes. After each block, the participants will report on a subjective 5 point scale about their experience.

Roles & Tasks Requried to complete the project
-----------------------------------------------
### Tasks:
#### Heart music
- Develop audio based on resting HR
- Convert HR signal to audio stream
- Tools: Python? Rhythmo.me 
- Data: Example HR data provided, participants own data (if wearing Fitbit)

#### Cognitive tasks
- Implement SART, Flanker’s, Posner’s Cueing and subjective scale 
- Tools: PsychoPy (Pavlovia)

#### Extension: 
- Enable real-time streaming and processing of HR data to generate audio
